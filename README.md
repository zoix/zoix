## üññ About me

Hello! I am an open-source enthusiast software engineer. I am passionate about everything that has to do with software & development, including web3, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and augmented and virtual reality.

In the last few months, I have been exploring and pretty much falling in love with [Urbit](https://urbit.org) and exploring how to integrate different tools into the ecosystem. If you are in the network, you can find me as `~master-midref`.

##### Languages I primarily use

## üéì What am I learning right now?

I am currently reading [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code][book] and exploring the process of large-scale application refactoring. It is a very polished book -like all the books from Margin Fowler- that explains best practices and appropriate steps, mechanics, tradeoffs, and obstacles to refactoring.

## üßô‚Äç What is my current side quest?

I am building the [Azimuth Shop](https://azimuth.shop) platform, a place to buy [Urbit](https://urbit.org) planets. It is made in NextJS and NestJS and consumes some external APIs provided by [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and [Infura](https://infura.io/).
